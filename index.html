                    <p>Aspiring future software developer from Adelaide, Australia<br> </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a articulate individual with passion in developing ideas from scratch and seeing them
                        thrive
                        into something evolutionary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my junior years, I studied Architecture and attained Bachelor's of Applied Science from
                        Curtin
                        University and went on to being a graduate Architect, however during the short stint within the
                        industry i realised that i lost my passion for the profession.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently I am enrolled within a Bootcamp for coding, challenging myself to learn new skills and
                        pursue a career within the tech industry. Hopefully, one day I will utilise my software
                        developer background
                        within entrepreneurship and develop a tech-startup.
