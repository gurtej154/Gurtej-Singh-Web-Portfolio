# Web Portfolio Project - Gurtej Singh
## Description 

Web portfolio project is an avenue to host all the previous, current, and future developer projects on one main platform for an employer, client, and business to observe and enquire information that will aid in their enquiry. 

A portfolio is means for individuals to showcase their work to future employers and clients to conduct business so with that in mind, the web portfolio needed to be designed to enable that connection and experience. During through the process, I was able bolster my current user-experience and user-interface skills to develop a functioning and effective portfolio webpage.

The webpage has a basic outline of storytelling, allowing the visitor to journey through the website through a planned manner. The web portfolio will be update occasionally, to incorporate new projects and maintain the user-experience and user-interface.
